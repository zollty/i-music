Vanilla Music is licensed under the terms of the [GPLv3 License](https://github.com/vanilla-music/vanilla/blob/master/LICENSE) 
since commit [a5255](https://github.com/vanilla-music/vanilla/commit/a525523bf1bb5dadfef544843966936c46e8310f) (older releases used the MIT License)

This means (among other things) that you are free to modify the source code and release your modified version.
However: Publishing such a modified version also *requires* you to:

* Provide the *full* source code of your modified version
* Keep the original copyright message as it is. (Eg: Do not delete the 'About' screen in Preferences)

These rules are pretty simple and fair, but some people just want to make a quick buck and upload modified (ad-infested) versions 
of Vanilla Music to the play store.

This list is a collection of such GPL violating versions published on the Google Play Store.
